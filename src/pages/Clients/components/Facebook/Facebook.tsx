        Facebook is a social media and social networking service owned by the
        American technology conglomerate Meta. Created in 2004 by Mark
        Zuckerberg with four other Harvard College students and roommates,
        Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes,
        its name derives from the face book directories often given to American
        university students. Membership was initially limited to Harvard
        students, gradually expanding to other North American universities.
        Since 2006, Facebook allows everyone to register from 13 years old,
        except in the case of a handful of nations, where the age requirement is
        14 years. As of December 2023, Facebook claimed almost 3.07 billion
        monthly active users worldwide. As of November 2024, Facebook ranked
        as the third-most-visited website in the world, with 23% of its traffic
        coming from the United States. It was the most downloaded mobile app
        of the 2010s.
